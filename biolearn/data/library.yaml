    title: 'FACS validation dataset: An optimized library for reference-based deconvolution
      of whole-blood biospecimens assayed using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC BeadArray
      (III)'
    summary: DNA methylation assessments of peripheral blood DNA can be used to accurately
      estimate the relative proportions of underlying leukocyte subtypes. Such cell
      deconvolution analysis relies on libraries of discriminating differentially methylated
      regions that are developed for each specific cell type measured. The relationship
      between estimated cell type proportions can then be tested for their association
      with phenotypes, disease states, and subject outcomes, or used in multivariable
      models as terms for adjustment in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We
      obtained purified neutrophils, monocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells,
      CD4+ T-cells, and CD8+ T-cells from healthy subjects and measured DNA methylation
      with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array platform. In addition, we measured
      DNA methylation with the EPIC array in two sets of artificial DNA mixtures comprising
      the above cell types. We compared three separate approaches to select reference
      differentially methylated region libraries (DMR library), for cell type proportion
      inference. The IDOL algorithm identified an optimal DMR library consisting of
      450 CpG sites for inferring leukocyte subtype proportions (average R2=99.2). Importantly,
      the majority of CpG sites (69%) in the IDOL DMR library were unique to the new
      EPIC methylation array, in that they were not present on the 450K array. Our new
      reference DMR library is available as a Bioconductor package, has the potential
      to reduce any unintended technical differences arising from the combination of
      different generations of array platforms, and may be helpful in generating larger
      DMR libraries that include novel cell subtypes. A  dataset of six whole blood
      samples were FACS sorted and the DNA was processed as a validation dataset.

    title: Many obesity-associated SNPs strongly associate with DNA methylation changes
      at proximal promoters and enhancers
    summary: 'Background: The mechanisms of how genetic variants (SNPs) identified in
      genome-wide association studies act to influence body mass remain unknown for
      most of these SNPs, which continue to puzzle the scientific community. Recent
      evidence points to epigenetic and chromatin state of the genome to have an important
      role.  Methods: 355 healthy young individuals were genotyped for 52 known obesity-associated
      SNPs and we obtained DNA methylation levels in their blood using the Illumina
      450K BeadChip. Associations between alleles and methylation at proximal cytosine
      residues were tested using a linear model adjusted for age, sex, weight category
      and a proxy for blood cell type counts. For replication in other tissues, we used
      two open-access datasets (skin fibroblasts, n=62; four brain regions, n=121-133)
      and an additional dataset in subcutaneous and visceral fat (n=149).  Results:
      We found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated SNPs associate with methylation
      levels at 107 proximal CpG sites. Out of 107 CpG sites, 38 are located in gene
      promoters, including genes strongly implicated in obesity (MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1,
      NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1, HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1, RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10, SKOR1, MAP2K5,
      SIX5, AGRN, IMMP1L, ELP4, ITIH4, SEMA3G, POMC, ADCY3, SSPN, LGR4, TUFM, MIR4721,
      SULT1A1, SULT1A2, APOBR, CLN3, SPNS1,SH2B1, ATXN2L, and IL27). Interestingly,
      the associated SNPs are in known eQTLs for some of these genes. We also found
      that the 107 CpGs are enriched in enhancers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
      Finally, our results indicate that some of these associations are not blood-specific
      as we successfully replicated four associations in skin fibroblasts.  Conclusions:
      Our results strongly suggest that many obesity-associated SNPs are associated
      with proximal gene regulation, which was reflected by association of obesity risk
      allele genotypes with differential DNA methylation. This study highlights the
      importance of DNA methylation and other chromatin marks as a way to understand
      the molecular basis of genetic variants associated to human diseases and traits.'

    title: 'Aging-associated DNA methylation changes in middle-aged individuals: The
      Young Finns Study'
    summary: Background  Chronological aging-associated changes in the human DNA methylome
      are studied by multiple epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS); however, the
      aging-associated DNAmet changes identified among different age groups and tissues
      vary and especially the rates of aging-associated alterations in the epigenome
      during adulthood remain unclear. Here, we further explore and characterize CpG-sites
      where DNA methylation levels alter at a constant rate during adulthood and are
      also independent of blood cell type heterogeneity.   Results  In the study, we
      observed 1,202 aging-associated CpG-sites (a-CpGs), of which 48% were hypermethylated
      with advancing age in whole blood with an especially narrow age range (40 - 49
      years). Repeatedly reported a-CpGs in ELOVL2, FHL2, PENK and KLF14 were also identified.
      Regions with aging-associated hypermethylation were enriched to several gene ontology
      terms (especially on the cluster of developmental processes), while hypomethylated
      sites showed no enrichment. The genes with a higher number of a-CpG hits were
      more often hypermethylated. Of the 1,202 aging-associated CpG-sites in the present
      study, 987 were identified in previous study (Vitality 90+) as differentially
      methylated also between nonagenarians and young adults in a previous study, and
      importantly, the directions of changes were identical in the previous and in the
      present study.   Conclusions  The set of 987 replicated a-CpGs presented here
      are altered in strong association with chronological aging in the whole range
      of adulthood. Consequently, future studies should note the variability of the
      types of a-CpGs, and the a-CpGs presented here should be dissociated from the
      environmental-sensitive CpG-sites or from regions that are associated with aging
      in a non-linear manner due to the accumulation of senescence-related features.
      This report offers detailed and verified pool of a-CpGs in which DNAmet levels
      associate linearly with chronological age and of which are different from the
      non-linearly changing ones.

    title: Identification of a DNA methylation signature in blood from subjects affected
      by Down syndrome
    summary: Down syndrome is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical signs, which
      include cognitive and endocrine disorders and haematological abnormalities. Although
      it is well established that the causative defect of Down syndrome is the trisomy
      of chromosome 21, the molecular bases of Down syndrome phenotype are still largely
      unknown. We used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to investigate DNA
      methylation patterns in whole blood from 29 subjects affected by Down syndrome
      (DS), using their healthy relatives as controls (mothers  and unaffected siblings).
      This family-based model allowed us to monitor possible confounding effects on
      DNA methylation patterns deriving from genetic and environmental (lifestyle) factors.
      The identified epigenetic signature of Down syndrome includes differentially methylated
      regions that, although enriched on chromosome 21, interest most of the other chromosomes
      and can be functionally linked to the developmental and haematological defects
      characteristic of the disease.

    title: "FlowSorted.BloodExtended.EPIC: An Enhanced DNA Methylation Library for
      Deconvoluting Peripheral Blood"
    summary: DNA methylation microarrays have been extensively used for
      understanding cell type composition in complex tissue samples. Here we
      expand on existing libraries for reference-based deconvolution of blood DNA
      methylation data assayed using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array to
      include 12 different leukocyte subtypes (neutrophils, eosinophils,
      basophils, monocytes, B cells naïve and memory, CD4+ and CD8+ naïve and
      memory cells, natural killers, and T regulatory cells). Application of the
      IDOL algorithm for identifying optimal libraries for the
      deconvolution of blood-derived DNA methylation data led to to a library
      consisting of 1200 CpGs. The accuracy of deconvolution estimates obtained
      using our IDOL-optimized library was evaluated using artificial mixtures
      with known cellular composition and in samples were both whole-blood DNA
      methylation data and FACS information were available. We further
      showcase potential applications of our expanded library using
      publicly available cancer, aging, and autoimmune disease data sets.

    title: "CD4T and CD8T naive and memory validation dataset: An Enhanced DNA
      Methylation Library for Deconvoluting Peripheral Blood"
    summary: DNA methylation microarrays have been extensively used for
      understanding cell type composition in complex tissue samples. Here we
      expand on existing libraries for reference-based deconvolution of blood DNA
      methylation data assayed using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array to
      include 12 different leukocyte subtypes (neutrophils, eosinophils,
      basophils, monocytes, B cells naive and memory, CD4+ and CD8+ naive and
      memory cells, natural killers, and T regulatory cells). Application of the
      IDOL algorithm for identifying optimal libraries for the deconvolution of
      blood-derived DNA methylation data led to a library consisting of 1200 CpGs.
      The accuracy of deconvolution estimates obtained using our IDOL-optimized
      library was evaluated using artificial mixtures with known cellular
      composition and in samples were both whole-blood DNA methylation data and
      FACS information were available. We further showcase potential applications
      of our expanded library using publicly available cancer, aging, and
      autoimmune disease data sets.
