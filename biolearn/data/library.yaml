  title: 'FACS validation dataset: An optimized library for reference-based deconvolution
    of whole-blood biospecimens assayed using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC BeadArray
    (III)'
  summary: DNA methylation assessments of peripheral blood DNA can be used to accurately
    estimate the relative proportions of underlying leukocyte subtypes. Such cell
    deconvolution analysis relies on libraries of discriminating differentially methylated
    regions that are developed for each specific cell type measured. The relationship
    between estimated cell type proportions can then be tested for their association
    with phenotypes, disease states, and subject outcomes, or used in multivariable
    models as terms for adjustment in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We
    obtained purified neutrophils, monocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells,
    CD4+ T-cells, and CD8+ T-cells from healthy subjects and measured DNA methylation
    with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array platform. In addition, we measured
    DNA methylation with the EPIC array in two sets of artificial DNA mixtures comprising
    the above cell types. We compared three separate approaches to select reference
    differentially methylated region libraries (DMR library), for cell type proportion
    inference. The IDOL algorithm identified an optimal DMR library consisting of
    450 CpG sites for inferring leukocyte subtype proportions (average R2=99.2). Importantly,
    the majority of CpG sites (69%) in the IDOL DMR library were unique to the new
    EPIC methylation array, in that they were not present on the 450K array. Our new
    reference DMR library is available as a Bioconductor package, has the potential
    to reduce any unintended technical differences arising from the combination of
    different generations of array platforms, and may be helpful in generating larger
    DMR libraries that include novel cell subtypes. A  dataset of six whole blood
    samples were FACS sorted and the DNA was processed as a validation dataset.

  title: Many obesity-associated SNPs strongly associate with DNA methylation changes
    at proximal promoters and enhancers
  summary: 'Background: The mechanisms of how genetic variants (SNPs) identified in
    genome-wide association studies act to influence body mass remain unknown for
    most of these SNPs, which continue to puzzle the scientific community. Recent
    evidence points to epigenetic and chromatin state of the genome to have an important
    role.  Methods: 355 healthy young individuals were genotyped for 52 known obesity-associated
    SNPs and we obtained DNA methylation levels in their blood using the Illumina
    450K BeadChip. Associations between alleles and methylation at proximal cytosine
    residues were tested using a linear model adjusted for age, sex, weight category
    and a proxy for blood cell type counts. For replication in other tissues, we used
    two open-access datasets (skin fibroblasts, n=62; four brain regions, n=121-133)
    and an additional dataset in subcutaneous and visceral fat (n=149).  Results:
    We found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated SNPs associate with methylation
    levels at 107 proximal CpG sites. Out of 107 CpG sites, 38 are located in gene
    promoters, including genes strongly implicated in obesity (MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1,
    NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1, HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1, RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10, SKOR1, MAP2K5,
    SIX5, AGRN, IMMP1L, ELP4, ITIH4, SEMA3G, POMC, ADCY3, SSPN, LGR4, TUFM, MIR4721,
    SULT1A1, SULT1A2, APOBR, CLN3, SPNS1,SH2B1, ATXN2L, and IL27). Interestingly,
    the associated SNPs are in known eQTLs for some of these genes. We also found
    that the 107 CpGs are enriched in enhancers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
    Finally, our results indicate that some of these associations are not blood-specific
    as we successfully replicated four associations in skin fibroblasts.  Conclusions:
    Our results strongly suggest that many obesity-associated SNPs are associated
    with proximal gene regulation, which was reflected by association of obesity risk
    allele genotypes with differential DNA methylation. This study highlights the
    importance of DNA methylation and other chromatin marks as a way to understand
    the molecular basis of genetic variants associated to human diseases and traits.'

  title: 'Aging-associated DNA methylation changes in middle-aged individuals: The
    Young Finns Study'
  summary: Background  Chronological aging-associated changes in the human DNA methylome
    are studied by multiple epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS); however, the
    aging-associated DNAmet changes identified among different age groups and tissues
    vary and especially the rates of aging-associated alterations in the epigenome
    during adulthood remain unclear. Here, we further explore and characterize CpG-sites
    where DNA methylation levels alter at a constant rate during adulthood and are
    also independent of blood cell type heterogeneity.   Results  In the study, we
    observed 1,202 aging-associated CpG-sites (a-CpGs), of which 48% were hypermethylated
    with advancing age in whole blood with an especially narrow age range (40 - 49
    years). Repeatedly reported a-CpGs in ELOVL2, FHL2, PENK and KLF14 were also identified.
    Regions with aging-associated hypermethylation were enriched to several gene ontology
    terms (especially on the cluster of developmental processes), while hypomethylated
    sites showed no enrichment. The genes with a higher number of a-CpG hits were
    more often hypermethylated. Of the 1,202 aging-associated CpG-sites in the present
    study, 987 were identified in previous study (Vitality 90+) as differentially
    methylated also between nonagenarians and young adults in a previous study, and
    importantly, the directions of changes were identical in the previous and in the
    present study.   Conclusions  The set of 987 replicated a-CpGs presented here
    are altered in strong association with chronological aging in the whole range
    of adulthood. Consequently, future studies should note the variability of the
    types of a-CpGs, and the a-CpGs presented here should be dissociated from the
    environmental-sensitive CpG-sites or from regions that are associated with aging
    in a non-linear manner due to the accumulation of senescence-related features.
    This report offers detailed and verified pool of a-CpGs in which DNAmet levels
    associate linearly with chronological age and of which are different from the
    non-linearly changing ones.

  title: Identification of a DNA methylation signature in blood from subjects affected
    by Down syndrome
  summary: Down syndrome is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical signs, which
    include cognitive and endocrine disorders and haematological abnormalities. Although
    it is well established that the causative defect of Down syndrome is the trisomy
    of chromosome 21, the molecular bases of Down syndrome phenotype are still largely
    unknown. We used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to investigate DNA
    methylation patterns in whole blood from 29 subjects affected by Down syndrome
    (DS), using their healthy relatives as controls (mothers  and unaffected siblings).
    This family-based model allowed us to monitor possible confounding effects on
    DNA methylation patterns deriving from genetic and environmental (lifestyle) factors.
    The identified epigenetic signature of Down syndrome includes differentially methylated
    regions that, although enriched on chromosome 21, interest most of the other chromosomes
    and can be functionally linked to the developmental and haematological defects
    characteristic of the disease.

  title: 'Umbilical cord blood artificial mixtures validation dataset: An Enhanced
    DNA Methylation Library for Deconvoluting Peripheral Blood'
  summary: DNA methylation microarrays have been extensively used for understanding
    cell type composition in complex tissue samples. Here we expand on existing libraries
    for reference-based deconvolution of blood DNA methylation data assayed using
    the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array to include 12 different leukocyte subtypes
    (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, B cells naive and memory, CD4+
    and CD8+ naive and memory cells, natural killers, and T regulatory cells). Application
    of the IDOL algorithm for identifying optimal libraries for the deconvolution
    of blood-derived DNA methylation data led to to a library consisting of 1200 CpGs.
    The accuracy of deconvolution estimates obtained using our IDOL-optimized library
    was evaluated using artificial mixtures with known cellular composition and in
    samples were both whole-blood DNA methylation data and FACS information were available.  We
    further showcase potential applications of our expanded library using publicly
    available cancer, aging, and autoimmune disease data sets.

  title: DNA Methylation Differences Associated with Social Anxiety Disorder and Early
    Life Adversity
  summary: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by
    extensive fear in social situations. Multiple genetic and environmental factors
    are known to contribute to its pathogenesis. One of the main environmental risk
    factors is early life adversity (ELA). Evidence is emerging that epigenetic mechanisms
    such as DNA methylation might play an important role in the biological mechanisms
    underlying SAD and ELA. To investigate the relationship between ELA, DNA methylation,
    and SAD, we performed an epigenome-wide association study for SAD and ELA examining
    DNA from whole blood of a cohort of 143 individuals using DNA methylation arrays.
    We identified two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with SAD
    located within the genes SLC43A2 and TNXB. As this was the first epigenome-wide
    association study for SAD, it is worth noting that both genes have previously
    been associated with panic disorder. Further, we identified two DMRs associated
    with ELA within the SLC17A3 promoter region and the SIAH3 gene and several DMRs
    that were associated with the interaction of SAD and ELA. Of these, the regions
    within C2CD2L and MRPL28 showed the largest difference in DNA methylation. Lastly,
    we found that two DMRs were associated with both the severity of social anxiety
    and ELA, however, neither of them was found to mediate the contribution of ELA
    to SAD later in life. Future studies are needed to replicate our findings in independent
    cohorts and to investigate the biological pathways underlying these effects.

  title: Trait related and differential DNA Methylation in obese and normal weight
    Brazilian women.
  summary: Obesity has been linked to lifestyle and recently have been associated
    to DNA methylation changes that may cause alterations in the adipogenesis and
    lipid storage processes and contribute to the pathological state. We enrolled
    Obese (Ob) and Normal Weight (NW) women. We observed that DNA methylation patterns
    are different between normal weight and obese women. This can alter gene expression
    patterns affecting adipogenesis and lipid storage. This results confirms that
    an obesogenic lifestyle can promote epigenetic changes in the human DNA.

  title: Human Aging-associated DNA Hypermethylation Occurs Preferentially at Bivalent
    Chromatin Domains
  summary: There is a growing realization that some aging-associated phenotypes/diseases
    have an epigenetic basis. Here we report the first genome-scale study of epigenomic
    dynamics during normal human aging. We identify aging-associated differentially
    methylated regions (aDMRs) in whole blood in a discovery cohort, and then replicate
    these aDMRs in sorted CD4+ T-cells and CD14+ monocytes in an independent cohort,
    suggesting that aDMRs occur in precursor haematopoietic cells. Further replication
    of the aDMRs in buccal cells, representing a tissue that originates from a different
    germ-layer compared with blood, demonstrates that the aDMR signature is a multi-tissue
    phenomenon. Moreover, we demonstrate that aging-associated DNA hypermethylation
    occurs predominantly at bivalent chromatin domain promoters. This same category
    of promoters, associated with key developmental genes, is frequently hypermethylated
    in cancers and in vitro cell culture, pointing to a novel mechanistic link between
    aberrant hypermethylation in cancer, aging, and cell culture.

  title: Cigarette Smoking Reduces DNA Methylation Levels at Multiple Genomic Loci
    but the Effect is Partially Reversible upon Cessation
  summary: DNA methylation is an epigenetic event whose pattern is altered frequently
    in a wide variety of human diseases. Smoking affects DNA methylation possibly
    leading to abnormal expression of a broad spectrum of genes which in turn may
    result to the various side effects and diseases associated with smoking. The long
    term effects of smoking have been widely studied but the mechanism(s) by which
    those effects may be reversible by smoking cessation are not clearly understood.
    Here, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study in peripheral-blood DNA
    in 464 individuals who were current, former and never-smokers. We identified 15
    distinct loci (10 of which were novel) where DNA methylation was reduced in smokers
    and was reversed (but did not reach non-smoking levels) upon smoking cessation
    within 12 weeks. Although the functional impact of this reversal of DNA methylation
    is still not understood, this study illustrates the potential of epigenomics to
    provide insights into mechanisms of environmental and lifestyle exposures, and
    to suggest new avenues for clinical intervention

  title: An Epigenetic Signature in Peripheral Blood Associated with Neurodegenerative
    Tauopathy and the Risk-Associated Haplotype on 17q21.31
  summary: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
    are two neurodegenerative diseases linked, at the pathologic and genetic level,
    to the macrutubule associated protein tau. We identified and replicated a dose-dependent
    effect of the risk-associated H1 haplotype on methylation levels within the region
    in independent datasets in blood and brain. These data reveal that the H1 haplotype
    increases risk for tauopathy via differential methylation, indicating a mediating
    role for methylation in dementia pathophysiology.

  title: Methylome-wide analysis of chronic HIV infected patients and healthy controls
  summary: Current therapy has turned HIV infection into a chronic condition. Clinically,
    some patients suffer prematurely from ailments associated with advanced age; however,
    the relationship between HIV and aging is unclear. Here we have collected a large
    cohort of HAART treated HIV+ subjects with both recent and chronic infection and
    recapitulated the shared phenotype of HIV and age. To further understand this
    signal, we applied validated models of DNA methylation-based biological age to
    establish a clear link between HIV infection and molecular age advancement. We
    then show this result to be robust to HIV duration, cellular composition, and
    general methylome disorder. Finally we show a pattern of hypomethylation in HIV+
    individuals at the HLA locus. Together these results lead to a much-needed better
    understanding of the epigenetic consequences and gerontological aspects of chronic
    HIV infection.

  title: Genome-wide DNA methylation levels and altered cortisol stress reactivity
    following childhood trauma in humans
  summary: DNA methylation likely plays a role in the regulation of human stress reactivity.
    In a genome-wide analysis of blood DNA methylation in 85 healthy individuals a
    locus in the Kit ligand (KITLG) gene (cg27512205) had the strongest association
    with cortisol stress reactivity (p=5.8x10-6). Replication was obtained in two
    independent samples, one using blood (N=45, p=0.001) and the other using buccal
    cells (N=255,p=0.004). KITLG methylation strongly mediated the relationship between
    childhood trauma and cortisol stress reactivity (32% mediation). Its genomic location
    (CpG island shore within an H3K27ac enhancer mark) provide further evidence that
    KITLG methylation is functionally relevant for the programming of stress reactivity.
    Our results extend preclinical evidence for epigenetic regulation of stress reactivity
    to humans and provide leads to enhance our understanding of the neurobiological
    pathways underlying stress vulnerability.

  title: Primary osteoporosis is not reflected by disease-specific DNA methylation
    or accelerated epigenetic age in blood
  summary: "Osteoporosis is an age-related metabolic bone disease. Hence, osteoporotic\
    \ patients might suffer from molecular features of accelerated aging, which is\
    \ generally reflected by specific age-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) changes.\
    \ In this study, we analyzed genome wide DNAm profiles of peripheral blood from\
    \ patients with manifest primary osteoporosis and non-osteoporotic controls. Statistical\
    \ analysis did not reveal any individual CG dinucleotides (CpG sites) with significant\
    \ aberrant DNAm in osteoporosis. Subsequently, we analyzed if age-associated DNAm\
    \ patterns are increased in OP. Using three independent age-predictors we did\
    \ not find any evidence for accelerated epigenetic age in blood of osteoporotic\
    \ patients. Taken together, osteoporosis is not reflected by characteristic DNAm\
    \ patterns of peripheral blood that might be used as biomarker for the disease.\
    \ The prevalence of osteoporosis is age-associated \u2013 but it is not associated\
    \ with premature epigenetic aging in peripheral blood."
