    title: Many obesity-associated SNPs strongly associate with DNA methylation changes
      at proximal promoters and enhancers
    summary: 'Background: The mechanisms of how genetic variants (SNPs) identified in
      genome-wide association studies act to influence body mass remain unknown for
      most of these SNPs, which continue to puzzle the scientific community. Recent
      evidence points to epigenetic and chromatin state of the genome to have an important
      role.  Methods: 355 healthy young individuals were genotyped for 52 known obesity-associated
      SNPs and we obtained DNA methylation levels in their blood using the Illumina
      450K BeadChip. Associations between alleles and methylation at proximal cytosine
      residues were tested using a linear model adjusted for age, sex, weight category
      and a proxy for blood cell type counts. For replication in other tissues, we used
      two open-access datasets (skin fibroblasts, n=62; four brain regions, n=121-133)
      and an additional dataset in subcutaneous and visceral fat (n=149).  Results:
      We found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated SNPs associate with methylation
      levels at 107 proximal CpG sites. Out of 107 CpG sites, 38 are located in gene
      promoters, including genes strongly implicated in obesity (MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1,
      NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1, HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1, RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10, SKOR1, MAP2K5,
      SIX5, AGRN, IMMP1L, ELP4, ITIH4, SEMA3G, POMC, ADCY3, SSPN, LGR4, TUFM, MIR4721,
      SULT1A1, SULT1A2, APOBR, CLN3, SPNS1,SH2B1, ATXN2L, and IL27). Interestingly,
      the associated SNPs are in known eQTLs for some of these genes. We also found
      that the 107 CpGs are enriched in enhancers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
      Finally, our results indicate that some of these associations are not blood-specific
      as we successfully replicated four associations in skin fibroblasts.  Conclusions:
      Our results strongly suggest that many obesity-associated SNPs are associated
      with proximal gene regulation, which was reflected by association of obesity risk
      allele genotypes with differential DNA methylation. This study highlights the
      importance of DNA methylation and other chromatin marks as a way to understand
      the molecular basis of genetic variants associated to human diseases and traits.'

    title: 'Aging-associated DNA methylation changes in middle-aged individuals: The
      Young Finns Study'
    summary: Background  Chronological aging-associated changes in the human DNA methylome
      are studied by multiple epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS); however, the
      aging-associated DNAmet changes identified among different age groups and tissues
      vary and especially the rates of aging-associated alterations in the epigenome
      during adulthood remain unclear. Here, we further explore and characterize CpG-sites
      where DNA methylation levels alter at a constant rate during adulthood and are
      also independent of blood cell type heterogeneity.   Results  In the study, we
      observed 1,202 aging-associated CpG-sites (a-CpGs), of which 48% were hypermethylated
      with advancing age in whole blood with an especially narrow age range (40 - 49
      years). Repeatedly reported a-CpGs in ELOVL2, FHL2, PENK and KLF14 were also identified.
      Regions with aging-associated hypermethylation were enriched to several gene ontology
      terms (especially on the cluster of developmental processes), while hypomethylated
      sites showed no enrichment. The genes with a higher number of a-CpG hits were
      more often hypermethylated. Of the 1,202 aging-associated CpG-sites in the present
      study, 987 were identified in previous study (Vitality 90+) as differentially
      methylated also between nonagenarians and young adults in a previous study, and
      importantly, the directions of changes were identical in the previous and in the
      present study.   Conclusions  The set of 987 replicated a-CpGs presented here
      are altered in strong association with chronological aging in the whole range
      of adulthood. Consequently, future studies should note the variability of the
      types of a-CpGs, and the a-CpGs presented here should be dissociated from the
      environmental-sensitive CpG-sites or from regions that are associated with aging
      in a non-linear manner due to the accumulation of senescence-related features.
      This report offers detailed and verified pool of a-CpGs in which DNAmet levels
      associate linearly with chronological age and of which are different from the
      non-linearly changing ones.

    title: Identification of a DNA methylation signature in blood from subjects affected
      by Down syndrome
    summary: Down syndrome is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical signs, which
      include cognitive and endocrine disorders and haematological abnormalities. Although
      it is well established that the causative defect of Down syndrome is the trisomy
      of chromosome 21, the molecular bases of Down syndrome phenotype are still largely
      unknown. We used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to investigate DNA
      methylation patterns in whole blood from 29 subjects affected by Down syndrome
      (DS), using their healthy relatives as controls (mothers  and unaffected siblings).
      This family-based model allowed us to monitor possible confounding effects on
      DNA methylation patterns deriving from genetic and environmental (lifestyle) factors.
      The identified epigenetic signature of Down syndrome includes differentially methylated
      regions that, although enriched on chromosome 21, interest most of the other chromosomes
      and can be functionally linked to the developmental and haematological defects
      characteristic of the disease.
